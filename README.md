# üëã Hi, I'm Zev

I'm a rising senior at Northwestern University studying computer science and physics.

This summer I'm working for [2Unstoppable](https://2unstoppable.org), which provides a free online program where any woman with a cancer diagnosis can sign up, create a profile, and ‚Äúmeet‚Äù other women in order to find an ideal fitness buddy based on criteria most important to them. This program is available to any woman who has had a cancer diagnosis.

I am also building [Swishify](https://www.swishify.app), a music sharing platform which extends Spotify's music & media services to enable users to share music with friends in a fun and meaningful way. Our intended audience is Spotify users who value the social experience music creates and believe music is better when shared with friends. Swishify is currently in Beta mode. You read more about why I am building Swishify [here](https://zevstravitz.com/why-i-am-building-a-platform-for-sharing-music/).

This past winter I built [Nreads](https://www.nreads.com), a marketplace for textbook transactions at Northwestern.

I'm also interested in the intersection between education and human-centered design. During the school year, I research Metacognitive Reflection in the [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/) program at Northwestern. If you're interested in this sort of stuff, you should check out [Zeved](https://github.com/zevstravitz/ZevedVideos), which is a project I worked on in fall 2019.

In summer 2019, I worked as a software engineer at SAS.

In my free time, I like reading, playing Hendrix on the guitar, and playing basketball with friends.
