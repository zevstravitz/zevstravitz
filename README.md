# Hi, I'm Zev üê≥

I'm passionate about building tools for education, collaboration, and coordination through human-centered design, and am currently studying CS at Northwestern (where I do research in HCI). Most of my recent projects ([Swishify](https://www.swishify.app), [Nreads](https://www.nreads.com)) fall in the world of full-stack web development, for which you can descriptions on my website below. In addition to my personal projects and work for [2unstoppable](https://2unstoppable.org/), I am studying how to build intelligent systems in my free time through [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646). I like to read!
